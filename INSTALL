Installing this example

prerequisites:
    Python3 (tested with 3.6)
    PostgreSQL database server (tested with 9.6.8)
    git
    Tested on Fedora 27

The following configuration is for development purposes only, once complete
(if ever...) the app should be packed and installed as whole.

1.  create Python virtual environment, preferably using the
    `mkproject ttracker`
    command. That should create directory `ttracker` inside your projects
    directory, for example ~/Workspace/ttracker .
    
    NOTE: This requires the virtualenvwrapper installed and configured.
    More info can be found at:
    `https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html`

2.  Go to your projects directory (cd ~/Workspace ) and find the just created
    project directory. It will be named ttracker, if you used the
    `mkproject ttracker` command.

3.  Delete the ttracker directory.

4.  While in projects directory (~/Workspace ), clone the project from GitHub,
    using command `git clone https://github.com/cedel1/ttracker.git`.
    You should now have new ttracker directory, with django project inside.

5.  Some Python packages need to be installed. Run:
    pip install -r ./ttracker/requirements.txt

6.  This example uses Postgresql as database backend, so install it, if one
    is not available.

7.  For running the app you will need a database user that can create
    databases. So create one, unless you already have one that you want to use.
    Let's suppose you name your user `testracker`.

8.  Create a database and name it `ttracker`. Really, any name would do, but
    using `ttracker` will save you the effort of changing the name in django app
    configuration later.

9.  Open ~/Workspace/ttracker/settings.py file and change the DATABASES section
    to point it to your postgresql server instance and user created in points
    6-8.
    Set the 'NAME', 'USER', 'PASSWORD', 'HOST' and 'PORT' properties.
    If more info is required, see
    `https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial02/`.

10. Go to ttracker directory (~/Workspace/ttracker/) and run the following
    command:
    python manage.py migrate
    That should have created all the necessary table in your database.

11. Now populate the database with data. Run:
    python manage.py loaddata initial_data.json

12. To see the app running run the following command:
    python manage.py runserver
    ands the point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

13. Enjoy :)
