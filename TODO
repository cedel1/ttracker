TODO

-   describe installation
-   write tests
-   consider writing custom validators for values users enter
-   there should be only one default value for IssueCategory and IssueStatus,
    so:

    a.  write a custom object save function that will delete default setting
        on other objects of the same kind
    b.  alert the user, that saving his object wiht default "on" will
        remove default on other objects
    
    or just write a custom form...
-   consider adding "closes_issue" to certain statuses - putting Issue to that
    status would automatically close it and removing the status would reopen
    the issue
-   consider issue reporter to be non-selectable, beeing set automatically,
    to the user that actually created the issue
